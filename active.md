  content="<br>I studied civil engineering at the <a href="http://www.metu.edu.tr">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a> and obtained B.S. degree in 2001. I joined <a href="http://www.ii.metu.edu.tr">METU Informatics Institute</a> for my graduate studies where I started to work on computer vision. I obtained M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Information Systems Department of Informatics Institute in April 2005 and July 2009, respectively. During my Ph.D. studies, I mostly worked on 3D computer vision especially when omnidirectional cameras are included. I was with the <a href="http://perception.inrialpes.fr"> Perception Group at INRIA Rhone-Alpes</a> as a visiting researcher for six months in 2008. I conducted a post-doctoral research visit to <a href="http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/research/visiongroup/"> Oxford Brookes Vision Group</a> in 2010. In 2011, I started as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Engineering, Izmir Institute of Technology. In 2017, I became an Associate Professor at the same department."%}
