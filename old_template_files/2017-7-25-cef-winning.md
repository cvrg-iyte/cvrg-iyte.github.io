Building up the Chapter Endowment Fund by building better men.

<!-- excerpt -->

[Last year](https://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2016/august/tech-triangle-chapter-wins-100000-prize.html),
the Chapter was awarded first place and received $100,000 for the Chapter Endowment Fund through the
[Judy and Larry Garatoni Building Better Men Program](https://www.triangle.org/events/buildingbettermen/).
This year, the Chapter was awarded with the second place prize of an additional $25,000 for the
Chapter Endowment Fund. Part of the rules of the program prevent you from winning the same place
multiple times over the course of 3 year program.

The Building Better Men Program originally consisted of a 3 year competition to encourage good chapter growth and establish
permanent improvements onto the chapters who enter. Judy and Larry Garatoni (pur58) approached the Triangle Education Foundation
with the idea for the program and funding for the prizes. If a chapter did win any prize money, they were required to then
continue to grow through their efforts to make sure that the changes to that chapter would be everlasting.
